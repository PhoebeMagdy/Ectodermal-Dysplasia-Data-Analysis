Comparing the accuracy of different machine learning (ML) algorithms to achieve an accurate prediction of the phenotype severity of ED cases from their genotype profiles. Accurate prediction is vital for forecasting future prognoses and the early planning of future therapies and proper preparation for genetic counseling with parents and patients also accurate foretelling of carrier detection of at-risk family members as well as a prenatal diagnosis is particularly important in severe life-threatening cases, this might help parents in the decision-making of miscarriage, or abortion, concerning religious considerations and the law of the country they belong to. Or else accurate prediction can derive parents to try new perspectives in treatments as was discussed by Dr. Holm Schneider in [8] where prenatal treatment of 6 boys was done by injecting the replacement protein into the amniotic fluid which induced the development of functional sweat glands. Followup showed that the two oldest boys treated in utero have a normal ability to sweat and this has so far persisted for more than 5 years. Thus, proper timing of protein replacement appears to be a promising therapeutic strategy for the most frequent ED and possibly additional congenital disorders.
